num-matcher
===========

A quick and dirty num matcher groovy script that I needed to get some work done without manual errors!

* Matches numbers from right hand side
* A range can be specified as the first argument eg 12345-50 will match 12345, 12346, 12347, 12348, 12349, 12350
* Requires groovy on /usr/bin/groovy or you can compile it with groovyc
